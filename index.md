Hi, my name is Will Fleury and I'm a Data Engineer, Data Architect and Machine Learning practitioner. I am originally from Ireland but have lived in Saigon, Vietnam and I'm currently residing in Barcelona. On this site I attempt to document interesting projects and ideas I've picked up along the way, in an attempt to organise my own thoughts and catalogue my professional journey.

My academic background is heavily engineering focused. However, I enjoy both the practical and theoretical aspects of problem solving. My PhD was in Decision Theory with applications primarily in Operations Research and Finance. 

I am lucky to have had the opportunity to work on a range of interesting problems with interesting companies. I have overseen the design and implementation of data platforms at the 1B+ user scale (see the following [blog series]({% post_url /data-engineering/2017-03-01-overview %}) for more details). I have served a range of other roles over the years and even tried my hand as a founder in a couple of startups. See my LinkedIn [Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willfleury) for more information.
