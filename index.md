Hi, my name is Will Fleury and I'm a consultant Data Engineer and Machine Learning practitioner. I'm lucky enough to be working on a range of interesting problems from portfolio optimisation to short term wind forecasting in the renewable energy sector. I worked as a Principal Data Engineer at [Boxever](http://www.boxever.com) in the field of Big Data for a number of years where I tuned my data processing and data architecture skills (see the following [blog series](/blog/boxever/overview.md) for more information). I served a range of other roles over the years and even tried my hand as a founder in a couple of startups. See my LinkedIn [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willfleury) for more details.

My academic background is more Engineering than Computer Science focused, however I have alternated in specialising between the two and don't quite consider myself to be purely in either camp. My PhD dissertation focused Decision Theory with applications primarily in Operations Research.

I've always enjoyed solving problems in a variety of domains and continue to do so for both professional and personal incentives. On this site I attempt to document interesting projects, facts and musings I've picked up along the way in an attempt to organise my own thoughts and catalogue my journey. If this in turn provides some useful information to others then that is a pleasant by-product. 

My areas of work and research cover:


Data Engineering 

* The latest architectures and toolkits for managing Big Data
* The JVM (one of the finest pieces of software engineering that exists)

Machine Learning

* Deep Learning (I started with MLP long before Deep Learning became the go to architecture)
* Dimensionality Reduction (using Generative Models in particular)
* Hyperparameter Optimisation
* Various other ML problems from classification to forecasting

Quantitative Analysis

* Portfolio Optimisation
