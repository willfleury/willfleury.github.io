Hi, my name is Will Fleury and I'm a Data Engineer, Data Architect and Machine Learning practitioner. On this site I attempt to document interesting projects, facts and musings I've picked up along the way, in an attempt to organise my own thoughts and catalogue my professional journey.

I am originally from Ireland but have travelled to many countries for both business and leisure. I lived in Saigon, Vietnam for a number of years before moving to Barcelona where I am currently based. My academic background is more Engineering than Computer Science focused. However, I enjoy both the practical and theoretical aspects of problem solving which is something I believe gives me an edge. My PhD dissertation dealt with managing Interdependence in Decision Theory with applications primarily in Operations Research and Finance. 

I am lucky to have had the opportunity to work on a range of interesting problems with interesting companies, covering fields from portfolio optimisation in finance, short term wind forecasting in the renewable energy sector, to personalisation in the travel industry. I worked as a Principal Data Engineer at [Boxever](http://www.boxever.com) for a number of years, where I oversaw the design and implementation of their data platform at the 1B+ user scale (see the following [blog series]({% post_url /data-engineering/2017-03-01-overview %}) for more details). I have served a range of other roles over the years and even tried my hand as a founder in a couple of startups. See my LinkedIn [Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willfleury) for more information.

I ensure to keep up to date with the latest practical and theoretical aspects in machine learning. At the end of the day, leveraging data is what building data platforms is all about and so knowledge on both sides of the divide is important. Similarly, I always try and get involved in the product direction at every company I work at, so I can better understand and feed back into the product vision.

My areas of work and research cover:

Data Engineering 

* The latest architectures, engines and data formats for managing Fast, Big Data
* Performance with the JVM

Machine Learning

* Deep Learning (I started with MLPs long before Deep Learning became the go to architecture)
* Generative Models
* Hyperparameter Optimisation
* Various other ML problems from classification to forecasting

Quantitative Analysis

* Portfolio Optimisation
