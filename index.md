Hi, my name is Will Fleury and I'm a Data Engineer, Data Architect and Machine Learning practitioner. On this site I attempt to document interesting projects, facts and musings I've picked up along the way in an attempt to organise my own thoughts and catalogue my journey. If this in turn provides some useful information to others then that is a pleasant by-product.

I am lucky to have had the opportunity to work on a range of interesting problems and fields from portfolio optimisation in finance, short term wind forecasting in the renewable energy sector to personalisation in the travel industry. I worked as a Principal Data Engineer at [Boxever](http://www.boxever.com) in the field of Big Data for a number of years where I oversaw the design and implementation of a data platform at the 1B+ user scale (see the following [blog series]({% post_url /data-engineering/2017-03-01-overview %}) for more details). I have served a range of other roles over the years and even tried my hand as a founder in a couple of startups. See my LinkedIn [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willfleury) for more information.

My academic background is more Engineering than Computer Science focused. However, I have alternated in specialising between the two and don't quite consider myself to be purely in either camp. This is something I believe gives me an edge when tackling new problems. My PhD dissertation dealt with managing Dependencies in Decision Theory with applications primarily in Operations Research and Finance. 

I always try to be involved in product direction at every company I work at as I believe that whether you are delivering a Data Platform or a Data Science model, you must first understand the business goals and be in a position to feed back into these goals.   

My areas of work and research cover:

Data Engineering 

* The latest architectures and toolkits for managing Big Data
* The JVM (one of the finest pieces of software engineering that exists)

Machine Learning

* Deep Learning (I started with MLP long before Deep Learning became the go to architecture)
* Dimensionality Reduction (using Generative Models in particular)
* Hyperparameter Optimisation
* Various other ML problems from classification to forecasting

Quantitative Analysis

* Portfolio Optimisation
