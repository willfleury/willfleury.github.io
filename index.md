I’ve been building products and teams in the AI space for some time now. At times on the side creating the AI models and at times on the side applying them. During this time, I’ve played many roles in engineering, data science, product, consulting and academia. I take a “Keep it Simple” approach to what I’m working on and the teams I lead. Above all, I love learning new things and meeting new challenges. I try to read a CS paper every day to stay on top of the latest and most important advances in the field (also for pure intellectual curiosity).

I have not published anything to this site in years. I’m hoping to change that soon. I have a few posts in the works on data architecture, machine learning and computer science. Stay tuned!
